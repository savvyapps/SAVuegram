# Vuegram

> A simple social media web app built with Vue.js and Firebase's Cloud Firestore as a way to teach people how to build a real-world app using the two technologies. Follow along with our tutorial, [Building a Real-World Web App With Vue.js and Firebase](http://savvyapps.com/blog/definitive-guide-building-web-app-vuejs-firebase), to learn core Vue.js concepts and build this project.

### Changelog
*We just released a major update in July 2020!* This release includes the current Vue CLI, async/await instead of promise chaining, and a structure overhaul incorporating updated best practices. The flow remains unchanged with some updates to match the current Firebase SDK. All code for the rewrite can be found in the project's `master` branch, while the old code remains in `original-deprecated` for posterity.

Changelog:

* Complete rewrite of existing project
* Async/Await instead of promise chaining
* More components vs. same file functionality
* Leveraging more actions vs. in-component requests to handle Firebase methods
* Simplified Firebase integration




### Project Overview

> In building this project, you'll learn how to:

* Start a production-ready project using Vue CLI.

* Maintain reactivity within your app by utilizing built-in Vuex features.
* Authenticate routes with vue-router.
* Read/write to a database using Firebase's Cloud Firestore.
* Set up authentication using Firebase.
* Leverage components, one of the more powerful features of Vue.js.
* Familiarize yourself with core Vue.js concepts.

### Get Started
